Red Earth?
To harbor life, some planets may not need a sun like our own -- a star that astronomers classify as a G-type. A planet close enough to a cooler red dwarf star may be plenty warm to support dark-hued life.

Mendez’ exoplanet-creating engine can depict how such a dim red star might color normally blue oceans black and clouds pink. The software can also render dark-colored land plants that might absorb infrared light instead of visible wavelengths.

Goldilocks Planets
If an exoplanet’s conditions are just right — perhaps as they might be at Kepler-22b — lakes of water might form on a terrestrial planet (above).

Mendez’ software images can also simulate Earth in previous eras. The snapshot below shows our home as it may have appeared 240 million years ago.

Oceanic and Icy Worlds
In addition to rocky and gassy worlds, the Scientific Exoplanets Renderer excels at oceans and ice.

Customization
Beyond the basic parameters available in Kepler’s exoplanet database, astronomers can improve the illustration with their own observations.

“Let’s say you get some new observations that suggest there’s a lot of water there,” Mendez said. “You can plug that in and create a better rendering on your own.”

Warm ‘Super Earths’
Most of the exoplanets discovered by Kepler are far larger than Earth. Nearly 30 percent, in fact, are “super Earth-sized,” which is a size between a gas giant and Earth.

These warm “super Earths” include Gliese-581d (rendered above) and HD85512b (below).

Gas Giants

Hot and Crusty
Despite aiming for accuracy, Mendez’ Scientific Exoplanets Renderer program does take some artistic license.

The software can add deep fissures to the surfaces of molten exoplanets (above), for example, or even impact craters to warm and rocky worlds (below).
